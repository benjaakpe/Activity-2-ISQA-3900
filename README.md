#### **Activity 2**

This activity consists in creating a website using HTML and CSS. The requirements include but not limited to: 

- having 2 custom pages,

- adding 1 image,

 I did create a webpage that has basic information about myself and 2 new hobbies that I have started since the pandemic

 The website will be simple and will not require special commands or application to access it.

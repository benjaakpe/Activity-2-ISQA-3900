            It is no surprise to assert that Covid 19 has significantly impacted our lives for the past few years.
            From job losses to feeling isolated, most people have been affected one way or another.<br>
            While all that was happening and we were quarantined, I had to figure our a new hobby that did not involve
            putting myself or others at risk. Thus, I started taking pictures of landscape, nature, still life,...
            I enjoy taking those picture because it provides me a way of connecting with nature. <br><br>

        <h1>Biography</h1>
        <br><br>
        My name is Benjamin Amoussou. I am originally from West Africa. I enjoy traveling, learning new things and playing sports.
        My favorite sport is soccer, yet I also enjoy playing volleyball. I also love learning about new technology.<br><br>
        The goal of this website is to demonstrate some of my HTML and CSS competencies and also tell you a little about myself
        and a few hobbies that I have developed during the pandemic .

        <p >
            I currently reside in Nebraska and this state has great fishing places. A few months ago, I got my first
            fishing license and gears and learned how to fish. I have been fishing in rivers and lakes. The first few
            times that I went fishing, I did not catch anything. However, I still had great time that I kept going back.
            That is because my focus is not on the fish. Instead, I see that as an opportunity for me to connect with
            nature, take time for myself to meditate and take a break from stress. <br><br>
